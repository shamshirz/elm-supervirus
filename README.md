# elm-supervirus

## About:

Best Port. Only Port.
Cheggit - [Supervirus](http://samgqroberts.com/sylverstudios/games/supervirus/)


The original was having some keyboard issues, so this is intended to relieve that pain by completely rewriting the entire project.

Makin' gaimz.

## Try it

* Just once
  * `npm install -g elm elm-format yarn`
* Whenever you change a dependency
  * `npm run prep`
* When you're working
  * `npm run start`
* Tests (from Root)
  * `elm-test`
* Build a prod version (minified)
  * `npm run deploy`



## Planning

### ~~Phase 1: Playable~~

  * ~~Collision detection~~
  * ~~Boundaries~~
  * ~~Scoring~~
  * ~~Smooth borders~~
  * ~~Enemy Movement~~
    * ~~Enemy wall bounce~~
    * ~~random in play~~
