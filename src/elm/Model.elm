{-| Reduces the metabolism towards a resting rate
This has a greater impact the higher the metabolism is from resting
change in metabolism is =
((current - resting) * .01)
This way your metabolism will never go below the resting, and it will
be more challenging the higher your metabolism (aka the better your combo)
