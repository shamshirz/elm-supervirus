{-| The domain is 2d vector math between lines and circles

Primary goal is finding the intersection between lines and circles,
and "bouncing" the line off of the interior of that circle.

This involves finding the Vector Orthoganol Projection of the line on
the normal line to the tangent of the intersection with the circle.

That was a mouthful, what does it mean?
Luckily, "normal line to the tangent of the intersection with the circle"
happens to be a unit vector from the intersection to the origin. This is a simple
line to find.

The line we are projecting is the line that originates inside the circle and has a
second point outside of the circle. We want that part that goes beyond the circle to
be "orthogonally projected" back inside the the circle (this is math for - bounce off
of the interior of the circle).

Caveats. We base all assumptions on the fact that we start with a point within the
bounding circle. If that is not the case, then we live in of world of Hurt (NaN floats)

*We use the Position and Velocity types internally to keep track of what's going on
but those aren't exposed externally*

Math.Vector2.Vec2's come in, and they go out. Simple
