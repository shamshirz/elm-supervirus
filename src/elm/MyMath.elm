module MyMath exposing (collisionPoint, safeSlope, inwardNormal, updatePositionAndVelocity)

{-| A not so great performance math library specifically for
finding the intersection of a line and a circle. We know there will be no evil
and thus we use a `safeSlope` that always returns a value, etc etc.

The primary function here is collisionPoint. which takes two points and the radius of a circle
assumed to have origin (0,0). It always returns the collision point from the direction you are
moving at.

You might wonder

  - how does it always return?
  - What if they don't collide?
  - What if you only collide at one point, like a tangent?

…The world may never know

import Math.Vector2 as Vector2 exposing (Vec2)


-- Whole thing. Bounce of of interior of a circle.
-- Given 2 points and a radius, we return a (Point, velocity) tuple
-- If no collision, whatever, return the next point and the current velocity
-- If a collision, do the baller shit
-- 1. Determine Collision Location
-- 2. Determine vector outside of boundary (direction * length)
-- 3. Determine normal unit vector towards origin
-- 4. Reject vector on normal vector


{-| Find the next point considering the boundary
If we land outside the boundary, then calculate the new point
and the new direction of the velocity.

If we aren't outside the boundary, the just return that new point
and the current velocity.
