{-| handleCollision
This is internal only, the exposed api should be nicer to work with
Like the handling multiple collisions and returning the new list and whether
we survived or not.

If we collide with another virus,
a. We are already dead from an earlier collision: remain dead
b. We are larger than the other virus: eat it
c. We are smaller than the other virus: we die
